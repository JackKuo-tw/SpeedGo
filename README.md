# Environment
- We suggest that your server is a Unix-like system.

1. After starting **server.py**, please wait at least 3 seconds before you run **client.py**.
2. You can freeze this programs into stand-alone executables by [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) if you want to run them on a computer without Python environment. Make sure you run the executables by Cmd or terminal which allows arguments.
